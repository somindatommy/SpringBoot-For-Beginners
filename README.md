# SpringBoot-For-Beginners
This repository contains a sample Spring Boot application developed to accompany a series of beginner-friendly articles. The goal of these articles is to guide readers through key concepts of building microservices with Spring Boot, while also introducing foundational topics such as:

- Database connections
- Transaction management
- Exception handling
- API security with token-based authentication

Each article in the series will explore these topics step by step, with this application serving as the hands-on example. The code in this repository will help you understand how to implement these concepts in a real-world Spring Boot application.

Feel free to clone this repository and follow along with the articles to build your own Spring Boot microservices!
